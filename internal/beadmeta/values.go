package beadmeta

// Value vocabulary for engine-minted structural metadata keys. These are DATA
// declarations only: which kinds a dispatcher accepts, which kinds trigger the
// graph contract, and what an outcome means remain decisions owned by the
// dispatch/formula/delivery packages. Routing keys (gc.routed_to,
// gc.run_target, gc.execution_routed_to) deliberately have no value vocabulary
// here — their values are config-supplied agent identities, and enumerating
// them would hardcode role names (forbidden by the ZERO-hardcoded-roles rule).

// Values of KindMetadataKey ("gc.kind"). Three predicates over this vocabulary
// coexist with deliberately different membership: the control-dispatch switch
// (internal/dispatch/runtime.go), the attempt-routing predicate
// (internal/dispatch/control.go isAttemptControlKind), and the graph-contract
// trigger (internal/formula/types.go metadataRequiresGraphContract). Each
// builds its own set from these constants; this block does not define which
// set is "right".
