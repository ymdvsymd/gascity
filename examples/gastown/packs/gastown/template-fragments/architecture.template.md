## Gas Town Architecture

Town root: `{{ .CityRoot }}`.

- **Controller** manages lifecycle.
- **Mayor** coordinates globally; **deacon** runs town patrols.
- Each **rig** owns a project, `.beads/` ledger, persistent **crew** workspace,
  transient **polecat** worktrees, **witness** health monitor, and **refinery**
  merge queue.
- **Dogs** run utility formulas such as shutdown dance and warrants.
- **Molecules** are multi-step formula instances that guide agent work.
