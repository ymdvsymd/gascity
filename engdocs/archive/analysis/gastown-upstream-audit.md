title: "Gas Town Upstream Audit"
---

Audit of 574 + 151 + 141 commits from `gastown:upstream/main` since Gas City
was created (2026-02-22). Delta 1: 574 commits through 2026-03-01. Delta 2:
151 non-merge, non-backup commits 977953d8..04e7ed7c (2026-03-01 to
2026-03-03). Delta 3: 141 non-merge commits 04e7ed7c..e8616072 (2026-03-03
to 2026-03-06). Organized by theme so we can review together and decide
actions.

**Legend:** `[ ]` = pending review, `[x]` = addressed, `[-]` = skipped (N/A), `[~]` = deferred

---

## 1. Persistent Polecat Pool (ARCHITECTURAL)

The biggest change in Gas Town: polecats no longer die after completing work.
"Done means idle, not dead." Sandboxes preserved for reuse, witness restarts
instead of nuking, completion signaling via agent beads instead of mail.

### 1a. Polecat lifecycle: done = idle
- [~] **c410c10a** — `gt done` sets agent state to "idle" instead of self-nuking
  worktree. Sling reuses idle polecats before allocating new ones.
- [~] **341fa43a** — Phase 1: `gt done` transitions to IDLE with sandbox preserved,
  worktree synced to main for immediate reuse.
- [~] **0a653b11** — Polecats self-manage completion, set agent_state=idle directly.
  Witness is safety-net only for crash recovery.
- [~] **63ad1454** — Branch-only reuse: after done, worktree syncs to main, old
  branch deleted. Next sling uses `git checkout -b` on existing worktree.
- **Action:** Update `mol-polecat-work.formula.toml` — line 408 says "You are
  GONE. Done means gone. There is no idle state." Change to reflect persistent
  model. Update polecat prompt similarly.

### 1b. Witness: restart, never nuke
- [~] **016381ad** — All `gt polecat nuke` in zombie detection replaced with
  `gt session restart`. "Idle Polecat Heresy" replaced with "Completion Protocol."
- [~] **b10863da** — Idle polecats with clean sandboxes skipped entirely by
  witness patrol. Dirty sandboxes escalated for recovery.
- **Action:** Update witness patrol formula and prompt: replace automatic
  nuking with restart-first policy. Idle polecats are healthy.

### 1c. Bead-based completion discovery (replaces POLECAT_DONE mail)
- [~] **c5ce08ed** — Agent bead completion metadata: exit_type, mr_id, branch,
  mr_failed, completion_time.
- [~] **b45d1511** — POLECAT_DONE mail deprecated. Polecats write completion
  metadata to agent bead + send tmux nudge. Witness reads bead state.
- [~] **90d08948** — Witness patrol v9: survey-workers Step 4a uses
  DiscoverCompletions() from agent_state=done beads.
- **Action:** Update witness patrol formula: mark POLECAT_DONE mail handling
  as deprecated fallback. Step 4a is the PRIMARY completion signal.

### 1d. Polecat nuke behavior
- [~] **330664c2** — Nuke no longer deletes remote branches. Refinery owns
  remote branch cleanup after merge.
- [~] **4bd189be** — Nuke checks CommitsAhead before deleting remote branches.
  Unmerged commits preserved for refinery/human.
- **Action:** Update polecat prompt if it discusses cleanup behavior.

> **Deferred** — requires sling, `gc done`, idle state management, and
> formula-on-bead (`attached_molecule`) infrastructure that Gas City
> doesn't have yet. The persistent polecat model is hidden inside
> upstream's compiled `gt done` command; Gas City needs explicit
> SDK support before this can be ported.

---

## 2. Polecat Work Formula v7

Major restructuring from 10 steps to 7, removing preflight tests entirely.

- [~] **12cf3217** — Drop full test suite from polecat formula. Refinery owns
  main health via bisecting merge queue. Steps: remove preflight-tests, replace
  run-tests with build-check (compile + targeted tests only), consolidate
  cleanup-workspace and prepare-for-review.
- [~] **9d64c0aa** — Sleepwalking polecat fix: HARD GATE requiring >= 1 commit
  ahead of origin/base_branch. Zero commits is now a hard error in commit-changes,
  cleanup-workspace, and submit-and-exit steps.
- [~] **4ede6194** — No-changes exit protocol: polecat must run `bd close <id>
  --reason="no-changes: <explanation>"` + `gt done` when bead has nothing to
  implement. Prevents spawn storms.
- **Action:** Rewrite `mol-polecat-work.formula.toml` to match v7 structure.
  Add the HARD GATE commit verification and no-changes exit protocol.

> **Deferred** — formula v7's submit step runs `gt done` (compiled Go).
> The HARD GATE and no-changes exit protocol can be ported independently
> as prompt-level guidance, but the full v7 restructuring depends on
> the persistent polecat infrastructure from S1.

## 3. Communication Hygiene: Nudge over Mail

Every mail creates a permanent Dolt commit. Nudges are free (tmux send-keys).

### 3a. Role template sections
- [x] **177606a4** — "Communication Hygiene: Nudge First, Mail Rarely" sections
  added to deacon, dog, polecat, and witness templates. Dogs should NEVER send
  mail. Polecats have 0-1 mail budget per session.
- [x] **a3ee0ae4** — "Dolt Health: Your Part" sections in polecat and witness
  prompts. Nudge don't mail, don't create unnecessary beads, close your beads.
- **Action:** ~~Add Communication Hygiene + Dolt Health sections to all four
  role prompts in examples/gastown.~~ DONE.

### 3b. Mail-to-nudge conversions (Go + formula)
- [x] **7a578c2b** — Six mail sends converted to nudges: MERGE_FAILED,
  CONVOY_NEEDS_FEEDING, worker rejection, MERGE_READY, RECOVERY_NEEDED,
  HandleMergeFailed. Mail preserved only for convoy completion (handoff
  context) and escalation to mayor.
  **Done:** All role prompts updated with role-specific comm rules. Generic
  nudge-first-mail-rarely principle extracted to `operational-awareness`
  global fragment. MERGE_FAILED as nudge in refinery. Protocol messages
  listed as ephemeral in global fragment.
- [x] **5872d9af** — LIFECYCLE:Shutdown, MERGED, MERGE_READY, MERGE_FAILED
  are now ephemeral wisps instead of permanent beads.
  **Done:** Listed as ephemeral protocol messages in global fragment.
- [x] **98767fa2** — WORK_DONE messages from `gt done` are ephemeral wisps.
  **Done:** Listed as ephemeral in global fragment.

### 3c. Mail drain + improved instructions
- [x] **655620a1** — Witness patrol v8: `gt mail drain` step archives stale
  protocol messages (>30 min). Batch processing when inbox > 10 messages.
  **Done:** Added Mail Drain section to witness prompt.
- [x] **9fb00901** — Overhauled mail instructions in crew and polecat templates:
  `--stdin` heredoc pattern, address format docs, common mistakes section.
  **Done:** `--stdin` heredoc pattern in global fragment. Common mail mistakes
  + address format in crew prompt.
- [x] **8eb3d8bb** — Generic names (`alice/`) in crew template mail examples.
  **Done:** Changed wolf → alice in crew prompt examples.

---

## 4. Batch-then-Bisect Merge Queue

Fundamental change to refinery processing model.

- [-] **7097b85b** — Batch-then-bisect merge queue. SDK-level Go machinery.
  Our event-driven one-branch-per-wisp model is intentional. N/A for pack.
- [-] **c39372f4** — `gt mq post-merge` replaces multi-step cleanup. Our direct
  work-bead model (no MR beads) already handles this atomically. N/A.
- [x] **048a73fe** — Duplicate bug check before filing pre-existing test failures.
  Added `bd list --search` dedup check to handle-failures step.
- **Also ported:** ZFC decision table in refinery prompt, patrol-summary step
  in formula for audit trail / handoff context.

---

## 5. Refinery Target-Aware Merging

Support for integration branches (not just always merging to main).

- [x] **75b72064 + 15b4955d + 33534823 + 87caa55d** — Target Resolution Rule.
  **Disposition:** No global toggle needed — polecat owns target via `metadata.target`,
  refinery reads it mechanically. Ported: FORBIDDEN clause for raw integration branch
  landing (prompt + formula), epic bead assignment for auto-land (formula), fixed
  command quick-reference to use `$TARGET` instead of hardcoded default branch.

---

## 6. Witness Patrol Improvements

### 6a. MR bead verification
- [-] **55c90da5** — Verify MR bead exists before sending MERGE_READY.
  **Disposition:** N/A — we don't use MR beads. Polecats assign work beads
  directly to refinery with branch metadata. The failure mode doesn't exist.

### 6b. Spawn storm detection
- [x] **70c1cbf8** — Track bead respawn count, escalate on threshold.
  **Disposition:** Implemented as exec order `spawn-storm-detect` in
  maintenance pack. Script tracks reset counts in a ledger, mails mayor
  when any bead exceeds threshold. Witness sets `metadata.recovered=true`
  on reset beads to feed the detector.

### 6c. MQ verification in recovery
- [-] **b5553115** — Three-verdict recovery model.
  **Disposition:** N/A — our reset-to-pool model covers this. Work bead
  assignment to refinery IS submission. Witness already checks assignee
  before recovering. No intermediate MR state to verify.

### 6d. Policy decisions moved to prompts (ZFC)
- [x] **977953d8 + 3bf979db** — Remove hardcoded escalation policy.
  **Disposition:** Replaced "In ALL cases: notify mayor" with judgment-based
  notification table in witness formula and prompt. Routine pool resizes
  no longer generate mayor mail. Witness decides severity.

---

## 7. Root-Only Wisps Architecture

From batch 3 analysis (session summary).

- [x] Root-only wisps: `--root-only` flag added to all `bd mol wisp` calls
  in patrol formulas (deacon, witness, refinery) and polecat work formula.
  Formula steps are no longer materialized as child beads — agents read step
  descriptions directly from the formula definition. Reduces Dolt write churn
  by ~15x.
- [x] All `bd mol current` / `bd mol step done` references removed from
  shared templates (following-mol, propulsion), all role prompts, and all
  formula descriptions. Replaced with "read formula steps and work through
  them in order" pattern.
- [x] Crash recovery: agents re-read formula steps on restart and determine
  resume position from context (git state, bead state, last completed action).
  No step-tracking metadata needed on the wisp bead.
- **Disposition:** No new `gc` command needed (upstream's `gt prime` with
  `showFormulaSteps()` is unnecessary — the LLM reads formula steps directly).
  We keep the explicit `bd mol wisp`/`bd mol burn` dance but with `--root-only`.

---

## 8. Infrastructure Dogs (New Formulas)

### 8a. Existing dogs updated
- [x] **d2f9f2af** — JSONL Dog: spike detection + pollution firewall. New
  `verify` step between export and push. `spike_threshold` variable.
  **Done:** mol-dog-jsonl.formula.toml created with verify step.
- [x] **37d57150** — Reaper Dog: auto-close step for issues > 30 days
  (excluding epics, P0/P1, active deps). `stale_issue_age` variable.
  **Done:** mol-dog-reaper.formula.toml created. ZFC revert noted (no
  auto-close decisions in Go).
- [x] **bc9f395a** — Doctor Dog: structured JSON reporting model (advisory).
  **Then** 176b4963 re-adds automated actions with 10-min cooldowns.
  **Then** 89ccc218 reverts to configurable advisory recommendations.
  **Done:** mol-dog-doctor.formula.toml uses advisory model. References
  `gc dolt cleanup` for orphan detection.

### 8b. New dog formulas
- [x] **739a36b7** — Janitor Dog: cleans orphan test DBs on Dolt test server.
  4 steps: scan, clean, verify (production read-only check), report.
  **Done:** mol-dog-stale-db.formula.toml. References `gc dolt cleanup --force`.
- [x] **85887e88** — Compactor Dog: flattens Dolt commit history. Steps:
  inspect, compact, verify, report. Threshold 10,000. Formula-only pattern.
  **Done:** mol-dog-compactor.formula.toml.
- [x] **1123b96c** — Surgical rebase mode for Compactor. `mode` config
  ('flatten'|'surgical'), `keep_recent` (default 50).
  **Done:** Included in mol-dog-compactor.formula.toml vars.
- [x] **3924d560** — SQL-based flatten on running server. No downtime.
  **Done:** mol-dog-compactor.formula.toml uses SQL-based approach.
- [x] mol-dog-phantom-db.formula.toml — Detect phantom database resurrection.
- [x] mol-dog-backup.formula.toml — Database backup verification.

### 8c. Dog lifecycle
- [x] **b4ed85bb** — `gt dog done` auto-terminates tmux session after 3s.
  Dogs should NOT idle at prompt.
  **Done:** Dog prompt updated with auto-termination note.
- [x] **427c6e8a** — Lifecycle defaults: Wisp Reaper (30m), Compactor (24h),
  Doctor (5m), Janitor (15m), JSONL Backup (15m), FS Backup (15m),
  Maintenance (daily 03:00, threshold 1000).
  **Done:** 7 order wrappers in `maintenance/formulas/orders/mol-dog-*/`
  dispatch existing dog formulas on cooldown intervals via the generic order
  system. No Go code needed — ZFC-compliant.

### 8d. CLI: `gc dolt cleanup`
- [x] `gc dolt cleanup` — List orphaned databases (dry-run).
- [x] `gc dolt cleanup --force` — Remove orphaned databases.
- [x] `gc dolt cleanup --max N` — Safety limit (refuse if too many orphans).
- [x] City-scoped orphan detection: `FindOrphanedDatabasesCity`, `RemoveDatabaseCity`.
- [x] Dolt package synced from upstream at 117f014f (25 commits of drift resolved).

### 8e. Dolt-health pack extraction
- [x] Dolt health formulas extracted from gastown into standalone reusable
  pack at `examples/dolt-health/`. Dog formulas + exec orders.
- [x] Fallback agents (`fallback = true`) — pack composition primitive.
  Non-fallback wins silently over fallback; two fallbacks keep first loaded.
  `resolveFallbackAgents()` runs before collision detection.
- [x] Dolt-health pack ships a `fallback = true` dog pool so it works
  standalone. When composed with maintenance (non-fallback dog), maintenance wins.
- [x] `pack.requires` validation at city scope via `validateCityRequirements()`.
- [x] Hybrid session provider (`internal/session/hybrid/`) — routes sessions
  to tmux (local) or k8s (remote) based on name matching. Registered as
  `provider = "hybrid"` in providers.go.

---

## 9. Prompt Template Updates

### 9a. Mayor
- [x] **4c9309c8** — Rig Wake/Sleep Protocol: dormant-by-default workflow.
  All rigs start suspended. Mayor resumes/suspends as needed.
  **Done:** Added Rig Wake/Sleep Protocol section + suspend/resume command table.
- [-] **faf45d1c** — Fix-Merging Community PRs: `Co-Authored-By` attribution.
  N/A — not present in Gas Town upstream mayor template either.
- [-] **39962be0** — `auto_start_on_boot` renamed to `auto_start_on_up`.
  N/A — Gas City uses `Suspended` field, not `auto_start_on_boot`.

### 9b. Crew
- [x] **12cf3217** — Identity clarification: "You are the AI agent (crew/...).
  The human is the Overseer."
  **Done:** Added explicit identity line to crew prompt.
- [-] **faf45d1c** — Fix-Merging Community PRs section.
  N/A — not present in Gas Town upstream crew template either.
- [x] **9fb00901** — Improved mail instructions with `--stdin` heredoc pattern,
  common mistakes section.
  **Done:** Added `--stdin` heredoc pattern and common mail mistakes to crew
  prompt. Generic example names (alice instead of wolf).

### 9c. Boot
- [x] **383945fb** — ZFC fix: removed Go decision engine from degraded triage.
  Decisions (heartbeat staleness, idle detection, backoff labels, molecule
  progress) now belong in boot formula, not Go code.
  **Done:** Boot already uses judgment-based triage (ZFC-correct). Added
  decision summary table, mail inbox check step, and explicit guidance.

### 9d. Template path fix
- [x] (batch 3) Template paths changed from `~/gt` to `{{ .TownRoot }}`.
  **Done:** All `~/gt` references replaced with `{{ .CityRoot }}` in mayor,
  crew, and polecat prompts.

---

## 10. Formula System Enhancements

- [-] **67b0cdfe** — Formula parser now supports: Extends (composition), Compose,
  Advice/Pointcuts (AOP), Squash (completion behavior), Gate (conditional
  step execution), Preset (leg selection). Previously silently discarded.
  N/A — Gas City's formula parser is intentionally minimal (Name, Steps with
  DAG Needs). Advanced features (convoys, AOP, presets) are spec-level concepts
  to be added when needed, not ported from Gas Town's accretion.
- [-] **330664c2** — GatesParallel=true by default: typecheck, lint, build,
  test run concurrently in merge queue (~2x gate speedup).
  N/A — Gas City formulas use `Needs` for DAG ordering. Gate step types
  don't exist yet. When added, parallelism would be the default.

---

## 11. ZFC Fixes (Zero Framework Cognition)

Go code making decisions that belong in prompts — moved to prompts.

- [-] **915f1b7e + f61ff0ac** — Remove auto-close of permanent issues from
  wisp reaper. Reaper only operates on ephemeral wisps.
  N/A — Gas City wisp GC only deletes closed molecules past TTL. No
  auto-close decisions in Go.
- [x] **977953d8** — Witness handlers report data, don't make policy decisions.
  Done in Section 6d.
- [x] **3bf979db** — Remove hardcoded role names from witness error messages.
  Done in Section 6d.
- [-] **383945fb** — Remove boot triage decision engine from Go.
  N/A — Gas City reconciler is purely mechanical. Triage is data collection;
  all decisions driven by config (`max_restarts`, `restart_window`,
  `idle_timeout`) and agent requests.
- [x] **89ccc218** — Doctor dog: advisory recommendations, not automated actions.
  Done in Section 8a.
- [-] **eb530d85** — Restart tracker crash-loop params configurable via
  `patrols.restart_tracker`.
  N/A — Gas City's `[daemon]` config has `max_restarts` and `restart_window`
  fully configurable since inception. Crash tracker disabled if max_restarts ≤ 0.
- **Remaining:** `roleEmoji` map in `tmux.go` is a display-only hardcode
  (see 12a — deferred, low priority).

---

## 12. Configuration / Operational

### 12a. Per-role config
- [-] **bd8df1e8** — Dog recognized as role in AgentEnv(). N/A — Gas City
  has no role concept; per-agent config via `[[agent]]` entries.
- [-] **e060349b** — `worker_agents` map. N/A — crew members are individual
  `[[agent]]` entries with full config blocks.
- [-] **2484936a** — Role registry (`autonomous`, `emoji`). N/A — `autonomous`
  is prompt-level (propulsion.md.tmpl). `emoji` field on Agent would remove
  the hardcoded roleEmoji map in tmux.go (ZFC violation) — deferred, low priority.

### 12b. Rig lifecycle
- [x] **95eff925** — `auto_start_on_boot` per-rig config. Gas City already has
  `rig.Suspended`. Added `gc rig add --start-suspended` for dormant-by-default.
  Sling enforcement deferred (prompt-level: mayor undocks rigs).
- [x] **d2350f27** — Polecat pool: `pool-init` maps to `pool.min` (reconciler
  pre-spawns). Local branch cleanup added to mol-polecat-work submit step
  (detach + delete local branch after push, before refinery assignment).

### 12c. Operational thresholds (ZFC)
- [-] **3c1a9182 + 8325ebff** — OperationalConfig: 30+ hardcoded thresholds
  now configurable via config sub-sections (session, nudge, daemon, deacon,
  polecat, dolt, mail, web).
- N/A — Gas City was designed config-first; thresholds were never hardcoded.
  `[session]`, `[daemon]`, `[dolt]`, `[orders]` cover all operational
  knobs. JSON schema (via `genschema`) documents all fields with defaults.

### 12d. Multi-instance isolation
- [x] **33362a75** — Per-city tmux sockets via `tmux -L <cityname>`. Prevents
  session name collisions across cities.
- **Done:** `[session] socket` config field. `SocketName` flows through tmux
  `run()`, `Attach()`, and `Start()`. Executor interface + fakeExecutor tests.

### 12e. Misc operational
- [x] **dab8af94** — `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1` during worktree add. Reduces
  polecat spawn from ~87s to ~15s.
  **Done:** Added to worktree-setup.sh.
- [x] **a4b381de** — Unified rig ops cycle group: witness, refinery, polecats
  share one n/p cycle group.
  **Done:** cycle.sh updated with unified rig ops group.
- [x] **6ab5046a** — Town-root CLAUDE.md template with operational awareness
  guidance for all agents.
  **Done:** `operational-awareness` global fragment with identity guard + Dolt
  diagnostics-before-restart protocol.
- [x] **b06df94d** — `--to` flag for mail send. Accepts well-known role addresses.
  **Done:** `--to` flag added. Recipients validated against config agents (ZFC).
- [-] **9a242b6c** — Path references fixed: `~/.gt/` to `$GT_TOWN_ROOT/`.
  N/A — Gas Town-only path fix. Gas City uses `{{ .CityRoot }}` template vars.

---

## 13. New Formulas (from batch 3)

- [~] 9 new formula files identified: idea-to-plan pipeline + dog formulas.
  Dog formulas done (Section 8). Idea-to-plan pipeline blocked on Section 1
  (persistent polecat pool changes dispatch model).
- [~] Witness behavioral fixes: persistent polecat model, swim lane rule.
  Blocked on Section 1 (persistent polecat pool).
- [~] Polecat persist-findings.
  Blocked on Sections 1/2 (polecat lifecycle).
- [-] Settings: `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt`.
  N/A — Gas Town doesn't have this setting either. Gas City already handles
  permission warnings via `AcceptStartupDialogs()` in dialog.go.
- [-] Dangerous-command guard hooks.
  N/A — prompts already describe preferred workflow (push to main, use
  worktrees). Hard-blocking PRs and feature branches limits implementer
  creativity. The witness wisp-vs-molecule guards remain (correctness),
  but workflow guards are prompt-level guidance, not enforcement.
- **Action:** Items 1-3 unblock after Sections 1/2.

---

## Delta 2: Commits 977953d8..04e7ed7c (2026-03-01 to 2026-03-03)

151 non-merge, non-backup commits. Organized by theme for triage.
Cross-references to Delta 1 sections (S1-S13) where themes continue.

---

## 14. ZFC Fixes (Delta 2)

Extends Section 11. Go code making decisions that belong in prompts or
formulas — refactored or removed.

- [-] **ee0cef89** — Remove `IsBeadActivelyWorked()` (ZFC violation). Go was
  deciding whether a bead was "actively worked" — a judgment call that belongs
  in the agent prompt via bead state inspection.
  N/A — Gas City never had this function. Witness prompt already handles
  orphaned bead recovery and dedup at the prompt layer (lines 85-104).
- [-] **7e7ec1dd** — Doctor Dog delegated to formula. 565 lines of Go decision
  logic replaced with formula-driven advisory model. The Go code only provides
  data; the formula makes decisions.
  N/A — Gas City was formula-first for Doctor Dog. `mol-dog-doctor.formula.toml`
  in `dolt-health/` topology already uses the advisory model upstream is
  converging toward. No imperative Go health checks ever existed.
- [-] **efcb72a8** — Wisp reaper restructured as thin orchestrator. Decision
  logic (which wisps to reap, when) moved to formula; Go code only executes
  the mechanical reap operation.
  N/A — Gas City has no wisp reaper Go code. Our `mol-dog-reaper.formula.toml`
  already has the 5-step formula (scan → reap → purge → auto-close → report)
  that upstream's Go is converging toward.
- [-] **1057946b** — Convoy stuck classification. Replaced Go heuristics for
  "is this convoy stuck?" with raw data surfacing. Agent reads convoy state
  and decides.
  N/A — Gas City has no convoy Go code. Convoys are an open design item
  (FUTURE.md). When built, will surface raw data per ZFC from the start.
- [-] **4cc3d231** — Replace hardcoded role strings with constants. Removes
  string literals like `"polecat"`, `"witness"` from Go logic paths.
  N/A — Gas City has zero hardcoded roles by design. Upstream centralizes
  role names as Go constants; Gas City eliminates them entirely. The
  `roleEmoji` map remains a known deferred item from S11.
- [-] **a54bf93a** — Centralize formula names as constants. Formula name
  strings gathered into a single constants file instead of scattered literals.
  N/A — Gas City discovers formula names from TOML files at runtime.
  Formula names live in config, not Go constants.
- [-] **1cae020a** — Typed `ZombieClassification` replaces string matching.
  Go switches on typed enum instead of `if classification == "zombie"`.
  N/A — Gas City has no compiled zombie classifier. Witness handles
  zombie/stuck detection via prompt-level judgment.
- [x] **376ca2ef** — Compactor ZFC exemption documented. Compactor's Go-level
  decisions (when to compact, threshold checks) explicitly documented as
  acceptable ZFC exceptions with rationale.
  Done: `mol-dog-compactor.formula.toml` updated to v2 — added surgical mode,
  ZFC exemption section, concurrent write safety docs, `mode`/`keep_recent`
  vars, `dolt_gc` in compact step, pre-flight row count verification.
  Also updated `mol-dog-reaper.formula.toml` to v2 — added anomaly detection,
  mail purging, parent-check in reap query, `mail_delete_age`/`alert_threshold`/
  `dry_run`/`databases`/`dolt_port` vars.

---

## 15. Config-Driven Thresholds (Delta 2)

Extends Section 12c. More hardcoded thresholds moved to config.

- [-] **f71e914b** — Witness patrol thresholds config-driven (batch 1).
  Heartbeat staleness, idle detection, and escalation thresholds now read
  from config instead of Go constants.
  N/A — Gas City was config-first from inception. `[daemon]` section has
  `max_restarts`, `restart_window`, `idle_timeout`, `health_check_interval`
  all configurable. Thresholds were never hardcoded.
- [-] **a3e646e3** — Daemon/boot/deacon thresholds config-driven (batch 2).
  Boot triage intervals, deacon patrol frequency, and daemon restart windows
  all configurable.
  N/A — same as above. Gas City daemon config covers these knobs.

---

## 16. Formula & Molecule Evolution (Delta 2)

Extends Sections 8 and 10. New formula capabilities and molecule lifecycle
improvements.

- [x] **ecc6a9af** — `pour` flag for step materialization. When set, formula
  steps are materialized as child beads (opt-in). Default remains root-only
  wisps per Section 7.
  Done: Added `Pour` and `Version` fields to `Formula` struct in
  `internal/formula/formula.go`. Parser preserves the field; schema
  regenerated. Behavioral use (creating child beads) deferred until
  molecule creation supports it.
- [x] **8744c5d7** — `dolt-health` step added to deacon patrol formula.
  Deacon checks Dolt server health as part of its regular patrol cycle.
  Done: Added `gc dolt health` command (`--json` for machine-readable output)
  to `internal/dolt/health.go` + `cmd/gc/cmd_dolt.go`. Checks server status,
  per-DB commit counts, backup freshness, orphan DBs, zombie processes.
  Added `dolt-health` step to deacon patrol formula with threshold table
  and remediation actions (compactor dispatch, backup nudge, orphan cleanup).
  Existing `system-health` step (gc doctor) retained as a separate step.
- [~] **f11e10c3** — Patrol step self-audit in cycle reports. Patrol formulas
  emit a summary of which steps ran, skipped, or errored at end of cycle.
  Deferred: requires `gc patrol report --steps` (no patrol reporting CLI yet).
  Concept is valuable — implement when patrol reporting infrastructure exists.
- [x] **3accc203** — Deacon Capability Ledger. Already at parity: all 6 role
  templates include `shared/capability-ledger.md.tmpl` (work/patrol/merge
  variants). Hooked/pinned terminology also already correct in propulsion
  templates. Gas City factored upstream's inline approach into shared fragments.
- [x] **117f014f** — Auto-burn stale molecules on re-dispatch. Confirmed Gas
  City had the same bug: stale wisps from failed mid-batch dispatch blocked
  re-sling. Fixed: `checkNoMoleculeChildren` and `checkBatchNoMoleculeChildren`
  now skip closed molecules and auto-burn open molecules on unassigned beads.
- [-] **9b4e67a2** — Burn previous root wisps before new patrol. Gas City's
  controller-level wisp GC (`wisp_gc.go`) handles accumulation on a timer.
  Upstream needed per-cycle GC because Gas Town lacks controller-level GC.
- [-] **53abdc44** — Pass `--root-only` to `autoSpawnPatrol`. Gas City is
  root-only by default (MolCook creates no child step beads). Already at parity.
- [-] **5b9aafc3** + **5769ea01** — Wisp orphan prevention. Gas City's
  formula-driven patrol loop (agent pours next wisp before burning current)
  avoids the status-mismatch bug that caused duplicate wisps in Gas Town's
  Go-level autoSpawnPatrol.

---

## 17. Witness & Health Patrol (Delta 2)

Extends Section 6. Witness patrol behavioral improvements and health
monitoring enhancements.

- [-] **cee8763f** + **35353a80** — Handoff cooldown. Gas Town Go-level patrol
  logic. In Gas City, anti-ping-pong behavior is prompt guidance in the
  witness formula, not SDK infrastructure (ZFC principle).
- [x] **ac859828** — Verify work on main before resetting abandoned beads.
  Added merge-base check to witness patrol formula Step 3: if branch is
  already on main, close the bead instead of resetting to pool.
- [-] **a237024a** — Spawning state in witness action table. Gas Town
  Go-level survey logic. Gas City witness checks live session state via CLI;
  spawning agents have active sessions visible to the witness.
- [-] **c5d486e2** — Heartbeat v2: agent-reported state. Requires Go changes
  to agent protocol. Gas City uses inference-based health (wisp freshness,
  bead timestamps). Self-reported state deferred to heartbeat SDK work.
- [-] **33536975** — Witness race conditions. Gas Town-internal fix for
  concurrent witness patrol runs conflicting on Dolt writes. N/A — Gas City
  uses filesystem beads with atomic writes.
- [-] **1cd600fc** + **21ec786e** — Structural identity checks. Gas Town
  internal validation that agent identity matches expected role assignment.
  N/A — Gas City agents are identified by config name, not role.

---

## 18. Sling & Dispatch (Delta 2)

Extends Section 12b. Dispatch improvements and error handling.

- [-] **a6fa0b91** + **5c9c749a** + **65ee6d6d** — Per-bead respawn circuit
  breaker. Already covered by Gas City's `spawn-storm-detect` exec
  order in maintenance pack (ported in S6b).
- [-] **783cbf77** — `--agent` override for formula run. Gas City sling
  already takes target agent as positional arg. N/A.
- [-] **d980d0dc** — Resolve rig-prefixed beads in sling. Already at parity:
  `findRigByPrefix`, `beadPrefix`, `checkCrossRig` in cmd_sling.go.

### 18f. Convoy parity gaps (discovered during S18.2 review)

Gas Town convoys are a cross-rig coordination mechanism with reactive
event-driven feeding. Gas City has convoy CRUD/status/autoclose but is
missing the coordination layer:

- [ ] **Reactive feeding** — `feedNextReadyIssue` triggered by bead close
  events via `CheckConvoysForIssue`. Without this, convoy progress depends
  on polling (patrol cycles finding stranded work).
- [ ] **`tracks` dependency type** — convoys use `tracks` deps to link
  issues across rigs. Gas City beads use parent-child only.
- [ ] **Cross-rig dependency resolution** — `isIssueBlocked` checks
  `blocks`, `conditional-blocks`, `waits-for` dep types with cross-rig
  status freshness.
- [ ] **Staged convoy statuses** — `staged_ready`, `staged_warnings`
  prevent feeding before convoy is launched.
- [ ] **Rig-prefix dispatch** — `rigForIssue` + `dispatchIssue` routes
  each convoy leg to its rig's polecat pool based on bead ID prefix.
  Gas City sling has prefix resolution but convoy doesn't use it.
- [-] **9f33b97d** — Nil `cobra.Command` guard. Gas Town internal defensive
  check. N/A.
- [-] **5d9406e1** — Prevent duplicate polecat spawns. Gas Town internal
  race condition in spawn path. N/A — Gas City's reconciler handles this
  via config-driven pool sizing.

---

## 19. Convoy Improvements (Delta 2)

New theme. Convoy is Gas Town's multi-leg work coordination mechanism
(a molecule whose steps route to different agents).

- [-] **22254cca** + **c9f2d264** — Custom convoy statuses: `staged_ready`
  and `staged_warnings`. Captured in S18f convoy parity gaps (staged
  convoy statuses).
- [-] **860cd03a** — Non-slingable blockers in wave computation. Captured
  in S18f convoy parity gaps (cross-rig dependency resolution).
- [-] **85b75405** — Capture `bd` stderr in convoy ops. Gas Town internal
  error handling improvement. N/A.

---

## 20. Pre-Verification & Merge Queue (Delta 2)

Extends Section 4. Adds a pre-verification step before merge queue entry.

- [~] **2966c074** — Pre-verify step in polecat work formula. Concept is
  sound (polecat runs build+test before submission to reduce refinery
  rejects). Deferred: add pre-verify step between self-review and
  submit-and-exit in mol-polecat-work when we tune the pipeline.
- [-] **73d4edfe** — `gt done --pre-verified` flag. Gas Town CLI flag.
  Gas City can use bead metadata (`--set-metadata pre_verified=true`)
  directly. N/A.
- [~] **5fe1b0f6** — Refinery pre-verification fast-path. Deferred with
  S20 pre-verify step above — refinery checks `metadata.pre_verified`
  and skips its own test run.
- [-] **07b890d0** — `MRPreVerification` bead fields. Gas Town MR bead
  infrastructure. N/A — Gas City uses work beads directly.
- [-] **b24df9ea** — Remove "reject back to polecat" from refinery template.
  Gas Town template simplification. Our refinery formula already handles
  rejection cleanly via pool reset.
- [-] **33364623**, **45541103**, **e2695fd6** — Gas Town internal MR/refinery
  fixes. Bug fixes in MR state machine. N/A.

---

## 21. Persistent Polecat Pool (Delta 2)

Extends Section 1. Incremental improvements to the persistent polecat model.

- [-] **4037bc86** — Unified `DoneIntentGracePeriod` constant. Gas Town Go
  daemon code. N/A.
- [-] **e09073eb** — Idle sandbox detection matches actual `cleanupStatus`.
  Gas Town Go witness code. N/A.
- [-] **082fbedc** + **5fa9dc2b** — Docs: remove "Idle Polecat Heresy".
  Gas Town moved to persistent polecats where idle is normal. Gas City
  polecats are still ephemeral (spawn, work, exit) — the Heresy framing
  is correct for our model. Update when/if we add persistent polecats.
- [-] **c6173cd7** — `gt done` closes hooked bead regardless of status.
  Gas Town `gt done` CLI code. N/A — Gas City polecats use `bd update`
  directly in the formula submit step.

---

## 22. Low-Relevance / Gas Town Internal

Bulk N/A items grouped by sub-theme for fast scanning. These are Gas Town
implementation details that don't affect Gas City's architecture or
configuration patterns.

### 22a. TOCTOU race fixes
- [-] ~7 commits fixing time-of-check/time-of-use races in compiled Go code.
  Gas Town-specific concurrency bugs in daemon, witness, and sling hot paths.
  N/A — Gas City's architecture avoids these patterns (filesystem beads with
  atomic rename, no concurrent Dolt writes).

### 22b. OTel / Telemetry
- [-] ~10 commits adding/refining OpenTelemetry spans, trace propagation,
  and metrics collection. Gas City has no OTel integration. N/A.

### 22c. Dolt operational
- [-] ~10 commits for Dolt SQL admin operations, server restart logic,
  connection pool tuning, and query optimization. Gas City uses filesystem
  beads, not Dolt. N/A.

### 22d. Daemon PID / lifecycle
- [-] ~7 commits improving daemon PID file handling, process discovery,
  and graceful shutdown sequencing. Gas City's controller uses `flock(2)`
  for singleton enforcement and direct process table queries. N/A.

### 22e. Proxy / mTLS sandbox
- [-] ~3 commits for sandbox proxy mTLS certificate rotation and proxy
  health checks. Gas Town infrastructure for isolated polecat networking.
  N/A — Gas City sandboxes are local worktrees.

### 22f. Namepool custom themes
- [-] ~6 commits adding themed name pools (e.g., mythology, astronomy) for
  agent naming. Gas Town-specific flavor. N/A — Gas City uses config-defined
  agent names.

### 22g. Agent memory
- [~] ~3 commits for `gt remember` / `gt forget` commands — persistent
  agent memory across sessions. Deferred — interesting capability but
  requires `gc remember`/`gc forget` CLI commands and agent bead metadata
  fields. Low priority vs core SDK work.

### 22h. Cross-platform / build / CI / deps
- [-] ~12 commits for Windows/macOS compatibility, CI pipeline fixes,
  dependency updates, and build system changes. Gas Town build infrastructure.
  N/A.

### 22i. Misc operational
- [-] ~15 commits for miscellaneous Gas Town bug fixes: tmux session cleanup,
  log rotation, error message improvements, CLI help text updates. N/A.

### 22j. Docs
- [-] ~2 commits: agent API inventory and internal architecture docs.
  Informational only — already captured in Gas City's spec documents.

## Delta 3: Commits 04e7ed7c..e8616072 (2026-03-03 to 2026-03-06)

141 non-merge commits. ~30 bd:backup, ~7 duplicate test fixes, ~5 dependency
bumps, ~5 Docker/CI. ~54 substantive commits organized by theme below.
Cross-references to Delta 1 sections (S1-S13) and Delta 2 (S14-S22) where
themes continue.

---

## 23. ZFC Fixes (Delta 3)

Extends Section 11 and 14. Go code making decisions that belong in prompts
or formulas.

- [-] **037bb2d8** — Remove ZFC-violating dead pane distinction from Go.
  Deacon Start() had cognitive branching (IsPaneDead vs zombie shell, magic
  500ms sleep). Replaced with uniform kill+recreate; auto-respawn hook
  handles clean exits.
  N/A — Gas City's reconciler is purely mechanical. No dead-pane-vs-zombie
  logic exists. Kill+recreate is already the only path.
- [-] **a5c5e31d** — Replace hardcoded help-assessment escalation heuristics
  with keyword-based classification. Go-level HelpCategory/HelpSeverity types
  for structured triage of HELP messages.
  N/A — Gas City has no Go-level escalation logic. Witness handles HELP
  assessment at the prompt layer.
- [-] **777b9091** — Replace hardcoded isKnownAgent switch with
  config.IsKnownPreset. Removes brittle switch statement over agent names.
  N/A — Gas City has zero hardcoded role/agent names by design.
- [-] **b5229763** — Consolidate GUPP violation threshold into single
  constant (30 min, defined in 3 files → 1).
  N/A — Gas City's GUPP timeout is per-agent config (`idle_timeout`),
  never hardcoded.

### 23a. Serial killer bug

- [-] **f3d47a96** — Daemon killed witness/refinery sessions after 30 min
  of no tmux output, treating idle agents as "hung." But idle agents waiting
  for work legitimately produce no output. The deacon patrol's health-scan
  step already does context-aware stuck detection.
  **SDK:** Gas City's health patrol should be audited to ensure it never
  kills agents for being idle. Currently health patrol uses `idle_timeout`
  config — verify the semantics are "idle since last prompt response" not
  "no tmux activity."

### 23b. GT_AGENT_READY sentinel env var

- [-] **3f699e7d** — Replace IsAgentAlive process-tree probing with
  GT_AGENT_READY tmux env var. Agent's prime hook sets the var; WaitForCommand
  clears it on entry then polls for it. Pure declared-state observation
  instead of ZFC-violating process tree crawling.
  **SDK:** Gas City already has `ready_prompt_prefix` in config for prompt-
  based readiness detection. The env var pattern is a useful complement for
  agents that wrap the actual CLI process (e.g., bash → claude). Consider
  adding `GC_AGENT_READY` support to `WaitForRuntimeReady`.

---

## 24. Nudge System (Delta 3)

New theme. Nudge delivery reliability improvements.

### 24a. Wait-idle as default

- [x] **6bc898ce** — Change default nudge delivery from `immediate` (tmux
  send-keys) to `wait-idle` (poll for idle prompt before delivering).
  Immediate mode interrupted active tool calls — the agent received nudge
  text as user input mid-execution, aborting work. Wait-idle falls back to
  cooperative queue (delivered at next turn boundary via UserPromptSubmit
  hook). `--mode=immediate` preserved for emergencies.
  **SDK:** Gas City's `NudgeSession` currently uses direct tmux send-keys
  (immediate mode). Should add `WaitForIdle` as the default delivery path
  with immediate as opt-in override. Also update nudge command help text.

### 24b. WaitForIdle false-positive fix

- [x] **dfd945e9** — WaitForIdle returned immediately when it found a `❯`
  prompt in the pane buffer, but during inter-tool-call gaps the prompt
  remains visible in scrollback while Claude Code is actively processing.
  Fix: (1) check Claude Code status bar for "esc to interrupt" — if present,
  agent is busy; (2) require 2 consecutive idle polls (400ms window) to
  confirm genuine idle state.
  **SDK:** Gas City's `WaitForIdle` (`tmux.go:1947`) has exactly this bug —
  single-poll prompt detection without status bar check or confirmation
  window. Port the 2-poll + status bar check.

---

## 25. Hook System (Delta 3)

### 25a. Consolidation to generic declarative system

- [-] **51549973** — Consolidate 7 per-agent hook installer packages into a
  single generic `InstallForRole()` function. Templates live in a centralized
  directory; adding a new agent requires only a preset entry + template files.
  No Go boilerplate.
  N/A — Gas City already has the generic `install_agent_hooks` config field
  + `internal/hooks/hooks.go` declarative installer. Validates our approach.
- [-] **730207a0** + **4c9767a1** — Remove old HookInstallerFunc registry and
  per-agent packages. Cleanup of the old system.
  N/A — Gas City never had per-agent hook packages.

### 25b. Cursor hooks support

- [x] **86e3b89b** — Add Cursor hooks support for polecat agent integration.
  `SupportsHooks = true` for Cursor preset, dedicated hook config files for
  autonomous and interactive modes.
  **Done:** Added Cursor hook support to `internal/hooks/`. Moved cursor
  from unsupported to supported, added `config/cursor.json` with Cursor's
  native hook format (sessionStart, preCompact, beforeSubmitPrompt, stop)
  calling gc prime / gc mail check --inject / gc hook --inject.
  `install_agent_hooks = ["cursor"]` now works.

### 25c. Hook bead slot removal

- [-] **fa9dc287** — Remove `hook_bead` slot from agent beads. The work bead
  itself already tracks `status=hooked` and `assignee=<agent>`. The slot was
  redundant and caused cross-database warnings. `updateAgentHookBead` is now
  a no-op; `done.go` uses `issueID` param directly; `unsling.go` queries by
  status+assignee instead of agent bead slot.
  **Gastown:** Our polecat work formulas reference `hook_bead` at
  `mol-polecat-work.formula.toml:95` and `mol-polecat-work-reviewed.formula.toml:136`.
  Verify `bd hook show` still works the same way (it should — the slot
  removal is internal to `gt`, not `bd`). The formula text "The hook_bead is
  your assigned issue" is still accurate terminology since the concept
  exists — only the internal storage slot was removed.

---

## 26. Cascade Close & Bead Lifecycle (Delta 3)

### 26a. --cascade flag

- [-] **38bc4479** — Add `--cascade` flag to `bd close` / `gt close`.
  Recursively closes all open children depth-first before closing the parent.
  Automatic reason noting the cascade.
  **Gastown:** Update formulas and prompts that close parent beads (epics,
  molecules) to use `--cascade` where appropriate. Currently formulas use
  plain `bd close`; `--cascade` saves agents from manually closing children.
  Add to quick-reference tables alongside `bd close`.
- [-] **b45d1e97** — Add cycle guard (visited set) and depth limit (50) to
  cascade close. Prevents infinite recursion from dependency cycles.
  N/A — Safety fix for the cascade implementation above.
- [-] **fdae9a5d** — Deprecate `CreateOptions.Type` in favor of `Labels`.
  N/A — Gas City beads already use labels as primary taxonomy.
- [-] **d27b9248** — Migrate `ListOptions.Type` caller to Label filter.
  N/A — Gas Town internal API migration.

---

## 27. Reaper & Lifecycle Tuning (Delta 3)

### 27a. Shortened TTLs

- [x] **2dd21003** — Shorten reaper TTLs: auto-close stale issues 30d → 7d,
  purge closed wisps 7d → 3d, purge closed mail 7d → 3d.
  **Gastown:** Update `mol-dog-reaper.formula.toml` vars to match new
  defaults: `stale_issue_age = "7d"`, `purge_age = "3d"`,
  `mail_delete_age = "3d"`. Our formula already has these as configurable
  vars — just update the default values.

### 27b. Reaper operational fixes

- [-] **6636f431** — Replace correlated EXISTS with LEFT JOIN in Scan/Reap
  SQL. Dolt query optimization.
  N/A — Gas City uses filesystem beads.
- [-] **b7d601aa** — Remove parent-check from purge queries to fix reaper
  timeouts. Dolt query fix.
  N/A — Gas City uses filesystem beads.
- [-] **0c20f4d9** — Correct database name from `bd` to `beads` in reaper.
  N/A — Gas Town naming fix.
- [-] **8ac6bf39** — Update stale DefaultDatabases and use DiscoverDatabases
  in CLI.
  N/A — Gas Town Dolt infrastructure.

---

## 28. Tmux Socket & Session Management (Delta 3)

Extends Section 12d.

- [-] **2af747fb** — Derive tmux socket from town name instead of defaulting
  to "default". Fixes split-brain where daemon creates sessions on wrong
  socket after restart without env var.
  N/A — Gas City already has `[session] socket` config field. Socket name
  flows through all tmux operations. Already at parity (S12d).
- [-] **3a5980e4** — Fix lock.go to query correct tmux socket; gt down
  cleans legacy sessions on "default" socket.
  N/A — Gas Town split-brain cleanup. Gas City doesn't have the legacy
  socket migration problem.
- [-] **b1ee19aa** — Refresh cycle bindings when prefix pattern is stale.
  N/A — Gas Town tmux keybinding fix.
- [-] **f339c019** — Reload prefix registry on heartbeat to prevent ghost
  sessions.
  N/A — Gas Town daemon internal. Gas City discovers sessions from config.

---

## 29. Prompt & Template Updates (Delta 3)

### 29a. bd close in quick-reference tables

- [~] **56eb2ed6** — Add `bd close` to command quick-reference tables in all
  role templates (crew, mayor, polecat, witness). Agents frequently guessed
  wrong commands (`bd complete`, `bd update --status done`). Also adds
  "valid statuses" reminder line.
  **Gastown:** Verify all role prompts in `examples/gastown/` have `bd close`
  in their quick-reference tables. Currently only crew prompt has it at
  line 328. Add to mayor, polecat, witness, and refinery prompts. Add valid
  statuses line.

### 29b. Context-budget guard

- [~] **330aec8e** — Context-budget guard as external bash script (not
  compiled Go). Threshold tiers: warn 75%, soft gate 85%, hard gate 92%.
  All thresholds configurable via env vars. Sets precedent that new guards
  don't need Go PRs.
  Deferred: interesting capability for maintenance pack. Would be a hook
  script or exec order that monitors agent context usage and triggers
  handoff/restart. Requires `GC_CONTEXT_BUDGET_TOKENS` env var plumbing.

---

## 30. Polecat & Agent Lifecycle (Delta 3)

### 30a. POLECAT_SLOT env var

- [-] **dafcd241** — Set `POLECAT_SLOT` env var for test isolation. Unique
  integer (0, 1, 2, ...) based on polecat position among existing polecat
  directories. Enables port offsetting: `BACKEND_PORT = 8100 + POLECAT_SLOT`.
  **Gastown:** Add `POLECAT_SLOT` documentation to polecat prompt and/or
  polecat work formula. Currently referenced only in witness prompt. Polecats
  need to know the env var exists so they can use it for port isolation.

### 30b. Branch contamination preflight

- [-] **a4cb49d7** — Add branch contamination preflight to `gt done`. Checks
  that the worktree is on the expected branch before pushing.
  N/A — Gas Town `gt done` internal. Gas City polecats use `git push`
  directly in the formula submit step; branch verification is prompt-level.

### 30c. Polecat operational fixes

- [-] **91452bf0** + **774eec92** — Reconcile JSON list state with session
  liveness in `gt polecat list`.
  N/A — Gas Town CLI display fix.
- [-] **e8616072** — Use ClonePath for best-effort push in nuke.
  N/A — Gas Town polecat nuke fix.
- [-] **9ff0c7e7** — Reuse bare repo as reference when cloning mayor.
  N/A — Gas Town performance optimization.

---

## 31. Sling & Dispatch (Delta 3)

Extends Section 18.

### 31a. Sling context TTL

- [~] **0516f68b** — Add 30-minute TTL to sling contexts. Orphaned sling
  contexts (from failed spawns) permanently blocked tasks from re-dispatch.
  Deferred: when Gas City implements sling scheduling, include context TTL
  from the start. Design note captured.

### 31b. Patrol & convoy operational fixes

- [-] **65c0cb1a** — Cap stale patrol cleanup at 5 per run, break early on
  active patrol found. Prevents Dolt query explosion under load.
  N/A — Gas City wisp_gc handles patrol cleanup differently (timer-based).
- [-] **72798afa** — 5-minute grace period before auto-closing empty convoys.
  Created convoys were closed before sling's `bd dep add` propagated.
  N/A — Gas Town convoy fix. Already captured in S18f convoy parity gaps.
- [-] **366a245d** — Increase convoy ID entropy (3 → 5 base36 chars).
  N/A — Gas Town convoy ID format.
- [-] **7539e8c5** — Resolve tracked external IDs in convoy launch collection.
  N/A — Gas Town convoy fix.

---

## 32. Deprecations & Cleanup (Delta 3)

All N/A. Gas Town internal migrations and removal of legacy code that
Gas City never had.

- [-] **3dafc81b** + **67bf22a6** — Remove legacy SQLite/Beads Classic code
  paths. Gas City never had SQLite beads.
- [-] **3137ca4b** — Remove deprecated `gt swarm` command and
  `internal/swarm` package. Gas City never had swarm.
- [-] **9106b59a** — Update deprecated `gt polecat add` references to
  `identity add`. Gas Town CLI rename.
- [-] **8895ae4d** — Migrate witness manager from `beads.GetRoleConfig` to
  `config.LoadRoleDefinition`. Gas Town internal migration.
- [-] **76ef3fa6** — Extract shared `IsAutonomousRole` into hookutil package.
  Gas Town internal refactor.
- [-] **279a1311** — Remove vestigial `sync.mode` plumbing and dead config.
  Gas Town config cleanup.

---

## 33. Miscellaneous (Delta 3)

Gas Town internal fixes, test improvements, and operational items. All N/A.

- [-] **907d587d** — Make `--allow-stale` conditional on bd version support.
- [-] **c54b5f04** — Fix dog_molecule JSON parsing for `bd show --children`.
- [-] **5a263f8e** — Normalize hook show targets, prefer hooked bead over
  stale agent hook.

## 34. Delta 4 Scope (2026-03-06 to 2026-03-12)

Raw graph delta since the previous cut point is 433 non-merge commits. 78
of those SHAs were already covered in earlier sections because side branches
merged later. Delta 4 therefore reviews the remaining 355 unique SHAs once,
bucketed into SDK gaps, Gastown example gaps, or no-action items.

## 35. SDK Gaps (Delta 4)

- [~] **63ebe645 + 3998fee1 + 39812adc + b03c4bb9 + 3430fc42 + 7e5dbf59 + de818831** — Hook/runtime parity for non-Claude agents.
  Upstream moved Copilot to executable hooks, added Codex hook profiles, and fixed non-Claude `prime --hook` behavior. Gas City still treats Codex as no-hook and still installs Copilot via `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. This is a real SDK parity gap for Gastown users on Codex/Copilot.

- [~] **7228d543 + 2abc36d7 + 3d5c721d + efb16615 + 7f3a8130 + daad4c90 + 6a0f4988** — Queued/deferred nudge delivery for non-Claude agents.
  Upstream now has a queue/poller path, deferred delivery, and reply-reminder nudges for runtimes without prompt detection. Gas City still has wait-idle plus immediate fallback only. This is an SDK gap, and the current Gastown prompt already documents queue/wait-idle modes we do not implement.

- [~] **8da798be + 43c2253c + 712c5b5f + ec99d68e + e502a90c + c11da4d8 + c889e513 + 3324f10b + 77092bb2 + 61b88b0e** — Crew targeting and `gt assign` ergonomics.
  Upstream added town-level `crew_agents`, `gt sling --crew`, and a one-shot `gt assign` flow with crew-name inference and validation. Gas City has neither `gc assign` nor crew-targeting equivalents today. This is a user-facing SDK gap for people dispatching work through Gastown crews.

- [~] **bfa4696c + 5850beaa + 96008270 + 560a2c5c + 7eb47927 + 897e42df + bfa042aa + 30a91067 + 5f9493fc + 3fde5616 + d0404d40 + 65445cd9 + da32d2c9 + f451959f + 24654548 + cffa8b40** — ACP propulsion parity.
  Gas City already has ACP transport, but it does not have upstream's propulsion stack: output suppression while propelled, trigger detection, larger buffering, event-driven propeller handoff, or the follow-up safety/test coverage. Treat this as an SDK follow-up gap rather than a missing first implementation.

- [~] **a6e349b8 + e9c4c65f + 64fc8ccf + 56e6ddf3** — Formula/runtime support needed by newer Gastown flows.
  These commits push base-branch and formula-var context through sling/done and make `no_merge` interact correctly with polecat completion checks. Gas City currently has `merge_strategy` metadata and formula layering, but not this newer variable propagation path. This is an SDK gap if we want the newer Gastown formulas to behave correctly.

## 36. Gastown Example Gaps (Delta 4)

- [~] **2e69cdfb + 716302d4 + 58fcf69d + 4b118101 + 48aeff95 + f09a1ddd** — Event-driven polecat/refinery lifecycle.
  Current `examples/gastown` still uses the older merge-failure/retry loop. It does not have `FIX_NEEDED`, `awaiting_verdict`, event-driven wake-up, or persisted merge-failure context. This is an example-pack drift, not a new SDK primitive.

- [~] **77c6683f + 48ed9983 + 07a89fcf** — `/review` and merge-strategy workflow changes.
  Upstream added a review command with A-F grading and taught refinery patrol to read merge strategy from config. Our Gastown example does not ship that command or the updated refinery formula. This belongs in the example pack.

- [~] **6c300d48 + 67cffe50** — `mol-idea-to-plan` v2.
  Upstream replaced the older idea-to-plan flow with an iterative review-round variant. We do not have that workflow in `examples/gastown` today.

- [~] **35a2697b + adee1fa6** — Crew/workspace ignore hygiene.
  Upstream now ignores `state.json` in crew workspaces. Our Gastown worktree bootstrap script still appends the older ignore block, so provider runtime state can still dirty worktrees. This is an example-pack cleanup item.

## 37. Not Relevant / Already Covered (Delta 4)

- [-] **7fcfe8e8** — Already covered in Gas City.
  Gas City already has formula `extends` and layered composition. The
  wait-idle default delivery items from this same upstream window were
  already closed in Delta 3 and are intentionally not duplicated here.

- [-] **72fd0867 + 71b8b335 + 7d7d6a2d + b5849a42 + cacc6bbc + 7c453ddc + a878480e + a141e9d5 + e13774c1 + ed0d57d5 + 6352bf29 + 46b230af + fcd4cedd + 910c5ca9 + f91b0dcc + d21ac919 + 6a61a434 + bfb35f94 + 3bb76a23 + b517404b + fd0ce340 + 1381a37d + b909de17 + 8cee1cf8 + 12fecc9d + 3f5b222d + 68c4a70b + 2e850c22 + bda902d7 + 4f899244 + 7cc2716b + 51aa93e9 + 0778f4b5 + d61b0491 + 112ff2c4 + 9ccb836f + 3dfd1322 + 9c4af4e2 + 9e5faf90 + 5603712c + cc62a8c6 + ab30e469 + dadbde86 + 0d3a4614 + e50c18d9 + 28f73f28** — `bd: backup` snapshots.
  Pure backups. Ignore for parity analysis.

- [-] **5ee0266e + 1c3b9718 + bae1b608 + 51cfea90 + e8d69598 + 4fb79ccb + cb6ce415 + e74e7101 + 86834615 + 30167352 + bf260dc7 + 3c5c04a6 + e3a5f80a + a4c4af9d + 4eba9d7f + 6b5f1125 + f591162c + d3d7d8b0 + 87ed4920 + 476b1a5a + 78c1c3f3 + ef412855 + 6263d9ea + 262708b0 + 1d6d5b1a + 2ef3f44c + 5378421d + d15149c3 + 6ebc538a + 4c5dd1c9 + 3e7a0696 + 2f38bce7 + 1df1723a + 62d45199 + f9ce9fc0 + 2f7270eb + a0d59455 + 8b020651 + 61248173 + c42daccf + 9b1c3ef3 + c6a14d27 + 2599d887 + 101606f2 + db4a6dcb + fa4e3385 + 4bca135f + dc6751b3 + f8e99c7c + 96717ec7 + dc16936c + c6f8fe12** — Docs / plans / CI / dependency churn.
  Test-only fixes, CI repairs, dependency bumps, research notes, planning docs, and documentation updates. No migration action.

- [-] **551582a1 + 8137131d + ac4b65d1** — Docker / sandbox deployment work.
  Container/sandbox packaging work for upstream GT deployments. Not part of the Gas City Gastown migration target.

- [-] **d9a72a5a + 04b347a2 + 482e20ff + b9b873ac + 3bfb3b71 + 00910d79** — Wasteland-only features.
  These are for the Wasteland domain, not Gastown-on-Gas-City.

- [-] **5a5deaac + 7a4ac8f7 + 879ea531 + 7478fd2b + f428b4f5 + 4369ae3f + 0f33903b + 94cd895d + 2fc2bab2 + 37346f36 + 7b322036 + a246a57f + 380fc9c2 + 59783678 + 44fe386a + d5b5d209 + c7cfa2d6 + d852cd4c + b38e8755 + a5feda45** — Plugin and dog ecosystem changes we are not porting.
  This whole cluster assumes upstream's plugin-oriented dog system (`plugin.md`, `run.sh`, `gt plugin sync`, exec-wrapper plugins, dolt-snapshots, git-hygiene, github-sheriff). Our current Gastown example uses formula/order scripts instead, so these are outside the migration scope.

- [-] **b3e154ca + 60743cb3 + 53567e64 + 4db877a0 + cf565d0b + a3fb88a4 + 630e879b + c1b25f94 + 3bf8a66e + 039f8dae + 1a568fb1 + 014bb428 + 2721ca2e + 6202ffc0 + 5e0d1c33 + fcb8f0e0 + 274f83b1 + dc1d11db + 8eea55bb + 554f4e92 + b965060d + aac5cfca + 67af59b3 + 309e0b08 + 3164aad7** — Beads routing / parser hardening.
  Upstream spent a lot of commits hardening `bd` JSON parsing, route/prefix lookup, hook-bead plumbing, and rig-db selection. Gas City already has tolerant `bd` parsing and route files, and the remaining fixes are tightly coupled to upstream's internal beads layer. Treat as no-action unless we later rebase onto that exact implementation.

- [-] **e78cad1e + 4a8cfa6d + 85b6309a + 252f12aa + 8278b1dc + 67d9b897 + a42a0323 + c0a06a67 + b734d532 + 6bdd92f7 + f6935ac4** — Upstream-only formula rendering polish.
  These are mostly `prime_molecule` and refinery-formula rendering improvements inside upstream GT. Our current example does not use that same compiled rendering path, so these are not direct parity blockers.

- [-] **2a6a60fb + 7ab25370 + 73072402 + db851a59 + a871bf25 + 5265043c + 2660def8 + a1ddecdb + db32280f + a358ef4e + 7272f84a + 4eaca225 + 70126b41 + b017a47d + 3530483b + c3810c40 + 33004801 + afe2abb4 + a40c358e + 0fbc53e9 + d2ac2842 + 847ee6b3 + f7864307 + b82a3782 + db23a436 + 8a509bbd + 6d1276ec + 18e04cc3 + 41e50cc9 + aaa46701 + 7801bb5f + 1be905bf + 01e4df5d + b97a04ea + deb8a525 + d09dc333 + f6e17f43 + 93c36e59 + 8cf48d08 + 6b68f907 + 44452cc4 + 9de066d2 + cf3bdbee + 86d3c77e + f1fea778 + e6808693 + 8358ade7 + 92082232 + ae72e8e1 + de45773a + 240a46e9 + 8001e007 + e9c29298 + 3fc20142 + f587f7ad + dd4f810f + 45b3f191 + 35ea9534 + 58d0d0c8 + 38f7b380 + d5bce7d5 + 25535b8e + c7102798 + dba1fa70 + 7ec0de9f + a0e0de27 + da38046e + 4a69240a + 6819afac + 7c40de01 + 98b748d8 + 13ad1a8c + 0f949769 + 6c24586e + ab71b3db + d7ef2d6e + e940b2e5 + 068b1dd8 + 8280d799 + db0b9765 + de2d8868 + e55e3f24 + 7a202c4e + 2f8c55d2 + 0dacd71b + fdff3cb6 + 8a9efdc0 + d51f9970 + ff43fa7a + 33434950 + c2e21d13 + f568c275 + ef364e64 + cdb2f04f + f993d6ce + 7084e376 + bcc7ac16 + 209e427d + 08c22cde + 54b9eb26 + e26cc408 + 2620ad10 + d5713eec + f379e3b3 + 87897b10 + 5b7a3789 + 5cb8a411 + 9a547ff1 + 4d35143f + d3a3df11 + 22a1630d + 1efc1ecd + 32298c6c + 2c33d11d + 3c3cbd31 + ce5a6a0a + d8f6467e + d06966a3 + 444a6fb1 + 66455650 + 19b224c5 + ab1d955d + 4b0604ed + f36aae76 + a7daaed5 + 93dc0ae2 + af08d79d + 92a0582d + f7c86cb7 + bb33adc8 + a47d883d + ca70658c + 7ea8586a + 3db786a4** — Upstream operational hardening tied to different internals.
  These are real upstream fixes, but they are aimed at upstream GT internals we do not mirror one-for-one: centralized Dolt, convoy/MR bead machinery, plugin scanner plumbing, daemon/tmux startup details, doctor/reaper policies, or assorted low-level hardening. I read them for regressions; none changed the bucketing above.

---

## 38. Delta 5 Scope (2026-03-12 to 2026-03-14)

Raw graph delta since the previous cut point is 130 commits: 86 non-merge
commits plus 44 merge commits on top of `67cffe50`. I reviewed the window
against current Gas City SDK code and the `examples/gastown` pack/config.
Delta 5 only lists new carry-forward items that still appear relevant after
the Delta 4 landing work; already-landed Delta 4 parity items are not repeated.

## 39. SDK Gaps (Delta 5)

- [x] **1d4ba3f8 + b91fdace + f3183e6a** — Gemini hook compatibility and stale-template auto-upgrade.
  Landed in Gas City via `0b7e7ec2` (`internal/hooks/hooks.go`): Gemini hooks now render an install-time absolute `gc` path, and the installer upgrades known-stale generated Gemini settings instead of preserving broken `export PATH=... && gc ...` templates indefinitely.

- [x] **305f9ee0** — Codex workspace trust dialog handling on startup.
  Landed in Gas City via `2fcb0952` (`internal/runtime/dialog.go`): startup dialog acceptance now recognizes Codex's "Do you trust the contents of this directory?" prompt alongside the existing Claude trust/bypass dialogs, so first-run Codex sessions no longer wedge at trust confirmation.

- [x] **894049af + 829c1510** — Shell-quote provider args when building runtime commands.
  Landed in Gas City via `bdbbf43c` (`internal/config/provider.go`): provider args now use shared shell-quoting before command-string assembly, and the session/dashboard parsing path was updated to round-trip those quoted commands correctly instead of misparsing metacharacters or spaced args.

## 40. Gastown Example Gaps (Delta 5)

- [x] **aecdc21c + e6516e5c** — Keep worktree ignores local and cover modern runtime files.
  Landed in Gas City via `f9e7205f` (`examples/gastown/packs/gastown/scripts/worktree-setup.sh`): polecat worktree bootstrap now writes runtime ignore patterns to the git exclude file resolved by `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude` instead of mutating tracked `.gitignore`, and the local ignore block now covers modern runtime paths including `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, `.opencode/`, `.logs/`, and `state.json`.

- [~] **1916b730** — Polecats should consult repo `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` when gate vars are unset.
  Upstream stopped treating empty `setup_command` / `typecheck_command` / `lint_command` / `build_command` / `test_command` vars as a silent skip and explicitly told polecats to read project `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` for the real Definition of Done. Gas City's `cmd/gc/formulas/mol-polecat-base.formula.toml` still tells polecats to skip empty commands silently, which can bypass project-specific gates in Gastown rigs that rely on repo instructions instead of pack config.

## 41. Not Relevant / Already Covered (Delta 5)

- [-] **754eb0cb + 7035b013** — Non-Claude attach liveness env plumbing.
  This was a bug in upstream's `gt crew at` flow. Gas City does not have that same path, and its reconciler already passes config-derived `ProcessNames` directly when checking live sessions.

- [-] **cfa46f61 + 728e5123** — Rig `default_formula` resolution.
  Gas City uses agent-level `default_sling_formula`, not rig-level workflow settings. Gastown's `polecat` pack entry already sets `default_sling_formula` (`examples/gastown/packs/gastown/pack.toml`).

- [-] **f613ef14** — Prior-attempt context injection when re-dispatching to polecat.
  Gas City's direct-bead workflow already preserves `metadata.branch` and `metadata.rejection_reason` on the same work bead, which gives the next polecat the equivalent resume context without separate MR lookup.

- [-] **2d70c434** — Missing refinery worktree auto-repair.
  Gas City's `worktree-setup.sh` (`examples/gastown/packs/gastown/scripts/worktree-setup.sh`) already recreates missing worktrees on session start. Upstream's corrupted `.git` repair case is narrower, and not a distinct carry-forward parity item yet.

- [-] **6c737acc** — Idle polecat reuse with live sessions.
  Relevant to the open same-session polecat recovery design issue, but Gas City does not yet implement idle-polecat reuse. Keep this bundled with the broader pooled-slot / same-session recovery work rather than treating it as an independent parity item now.

- [-] **ee2d0ea1 + cba12f34 + a4f99b59** — Repo-sourced rig settings via `.gastown/settings.json`.
  This is upstream-specific config architecture. Gas City's pack/config model is different, so there is no direct port.

- [-] **bb36a57f + 7335e05b + e36fb88c** — Promptless role-agent startup wording.
  The specific upstream `prime_output.go` wording change does not map 1:1 to Gas City's prompt-template + hook-beacon startup path. Keep watching this area, but there is no concrete port item from these commits alone.

- [-] **0ea67982 + d2fb7f92 + 3fa6d9e2** — Auto-supersede stale MR attempts.
  Real upstream fix, but tightly coupled to upstream's MR-bead queue and repeat-attempt lifecycle. Revisit only if Gas City's `merge_strategy=mr` flow grows an equivalent repeated-attempt contract.
